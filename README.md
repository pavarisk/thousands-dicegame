## Scoring System

In Thousands Dice Game, each number on the left of the "=" represents a combination of dice that you can score on your turn. Here's the scoring system:

- 5 = 50 points
- 1 = 100 points
- 2 2 2 = 200 points
- 3 3 3 = 300 points
- 4 4 4 = 400 points
- 5 5 5 = 500 points
- 6 6 6 = 600 points
- 1 1 1 = 1,000 points
- 1 2 3 4 5 6 = 500 points

In the 10,000s game mode, additional scoring is available, as shown below:

```
--------------------------
1 2 3 4 5 6 = 1,000 points
2 2 2 2 = 2,000 points
3 3 3 3 = 3,000 points
4 4 4 4 = 4,000 points
5 5 5 5 = 5,000 points
6 6 6 6 = 6,000 points
1 1 1 1 = 10,000 points
```

If there are no possible scores you can take from your roll, it will result in an "X." In a 5,000s game, you'll lose 500 points for accumulating 3 "X"s, while in a 10,000s game, you'll lose 1,000 points.

## Game Modes

Thousands Dice Game offers two game modes:

**1. 5,000s Mode:**
- Players get 3 chances to roll the dice on their turn.
- Each roll requires at least one die to be taken as a score to add to your turn score.
- You will only have 3 chances to roll, with each roll having one less die than the previous roll.
- If you fail to get any scoring dice (1 or 5) in a roll, it results in an "X."

**2. 10,000s Mode:**
- There is no limit to the number of rolls you can make in this mode.
- You have a choice of starting fresh or with the previous player's ending score and dice.
- Starting fresh is similar to a 5,000s game but with added scores, including the thousands and straights worth 1,000 points instead of 500.
- The reroll system allows for as many rerolls as you want, provided you can score every reroll.
- You can use the "straight" (1 2 3 4 5 6) from the dice you have scored in your previous roll.
- If you start with the previous player's ending score, you take their score and their dice and carry on as if you've been playing yourself.
- Failing to score on a roll results in an "X," but you can continue your turn if you can score at least one die.

## How to Play

### Scoring in the 5,000s Game

1. You get 3 chances to roll the dice on your turn.
2. On your turn, roll all 6 dice.
3. For each roll, you must take at least one die as a score to add to your turn score.
4. There are only 3 chances to roll, with each roll having at least one die less than the last.
5. If you fail to score in a roll (i.e., you don't roll any 1s or 5s), it results in an "X."
6. If you score all six dice in a single roll, you can reroll the six dice and add that score to your turn score.
7. The only score you can take with the dice you have scored in your previous roll is a "straight" (1 2 3 4 5 6).

### Scoring in the 10,000s Game

1. There is no limit to the number of rolls in this mode.
2. You can choose to start fresh, similar to the 5,000s game but with added scores (including thousands and higher straight values), or start with the previous player's ending score.
3. If you start with the previous player's ending score and dice, you continue as if you've been playing yourself.
4. Failing to score in a roll results in an "X," but you can continue your turn if you can score at least one die.
5. The straight (1 2 3 4 5 6) from the dice you have scored in your previous roll can be used for scoring.

## How to Win

You win by accumulating points on your turn until you reach the winning score. However, if you score in a way that surpasses the winning score, and there are no alternative scoring options available, it results in an "X."
